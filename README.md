# ECHI prompts

HTML code for displaying the ECHI prompts.

- Displays the conversation prompt and a timer.
- The timer counts down from a preset duration (e.g. six minutes) and then turns red.
- A button progresses to the next prompt and resets the timer.
- The users can press the next button before the timer runs out and stay on the same conversation after the timer runs out. i.e., the timer is just a guide.
- The page user browser storage to save the current prompt so that it will start on the next prompt when the page is reloaded.

Note, the conversation prompts are stored directly in the html file for simplicity. Initially the page will hold some dummy data but will be replaced with the actual prompts, i.e. will need perhaps 160 or so.

"Generate a list of 300 unique conversation prompts designed to stimulate a discussion between four people. Each prompt should be completely self-contained, suitable for all ages, and avoid controversial or triggering topics. The prompts should encourage the group to come to a consensus decision on a fun, creative, or practical topic. Avoid organizing the prompts by theme, and ensure that each stands alone.

Good examples include:

- Can you design a three-course dinner menu exclusively with dishes none of you like?
- If you could travel together in time and space, can you agree on where you would go and who you would like to meet?
- If you looked at the overall picture, could you agree on a European country (other than the UK) that you would all like to settle down in?
- Big or small, agree on which city in the UK is loveliest in summer and which city is loveliest in winter?
- If you were to invent a fun and new primary-school subject together, what would it be?
- If you were to choose a hobby, not limited to sports, that all of you were to do the rest of your lives, what would it be?
- If you were forced to watch the same movie together 5 times in a row, what movie would it be?
- Can you find a film that almost everyone has seen, none of you have not seen?
- If each of you had to pick one dish to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?
- Can you agree on one thing that is you all have a hard time eating up after taking a few bites?
- If you had to agree on something you should eat every day for a month, what would it be?

The prompts should cover a wide variety of topics, such as activities, travel, group decisions, games, and creative ideas, ensuring they stay engaging and versatile."
