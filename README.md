# ECHI prompts

HTML code for displaying the ECHI prompts.

- Displays the conversation prompt and a timer.
- The timer counts down from a preset duration (e.g. six minutes) and then turns red.
- A button progresses to the next prompt and resets the timer.
- The users can press the next button before the timer runs out and stay on the same conversation after the timer runs out. i.e., the timer is just a guide.
- The page user browser storage to save the current prompt so that it will start on the next prompt when the page is reloaded.

Note, the conversation prompts are stored directly in the html file for simplicity. Initially the page will hold some dummy data but will be replaced with the actual prompts, i.e. will need perhaps 160 or so.
